# An example of using multiple concepts to solve a variant of the cartpole task:
# keeping the pole balanced on the cart while moving the cart to a specified point.
# 
# This example breaks that task into 4 concepts:
#   - ComputeDelta: transform the state to compute the difference between the 
#     current and target positions. This makes the policy independent of the 
#     specific position of the cart, so it is easier and faster to learn.
#   - GoLeft: this applies when the cart is to the right of the target position, and learns 
#     how to move the cart left without dropping the pole.
#   - GoRight: this applies when the cart is to the left of the target position, and learns 
#     how to move the cart right without dropping the pole.
#   - PickOne: a programmed rule that passes through the action output by GoLeft or GoRight, 
#     as appropriate for the current state.
