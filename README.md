## Sample Code

Samples that show how to use microsoft-bonsai-api and connect with the Bonsai platform.

### Python

[bonsai-common](https://github.com/microsoft/bonsai-common) - A python framework for interfacing with the bonsai platform.

[cartpole](https://github.com/microsoft/microsoft-bonsai-api/tree/main/Python/samples/cartpole) - Classic CartPole simulator in Python. Balancing an inverted pendulum on a moving cart.

[moab](https://github.com/microsoft/microsoft-bonsai-api/tree/moablogger/Python/samples/moab) - Teach an AI agent to balance a ball in the center of the Moab bot's plate.

[house-energy](https://github.com/microsoft/microsoft-bonsai-api/tree/main/Python/samples/house-energy) - Control the temperature inside of a house according to the desired set temperatures just like a thermostat.

[quanser-qube](https://github.com/microsoft/microsoft-bonsai-api/tree/main/Python/samples/quanser-qube) - Simulation of the real hardware, academic learning tool: Quanser Qube. Swing Up and Balancing an inverted pendulum with a rotary base.

[house-energy](https://github.com/microsoft/microsoft-bonsai-api/tree/main/Python/samples/house-energy) - Simulator for controlling the temperature inside of a house to a desired temperatures, just like a thermostat.

[highway-env](https://github.com/microsoft/microsoft-bonsai-api/tree/main/Python/samples/gym-highway) - Make decisions to speed up, slow down, change lanes, etc with a multi-lane highway. This sample uses arrays in Inkling for states and demonstrates usage of using an element of the array in the reward.

[moabsim-py](https://github.com/microsoft/microsoft-bonsai-api/tree/main/Python/samples/moabsim-py) - Simulator for balancing a ball on a plate, based on hardware. Tutorial 2 is meant for deployment. Additional Inkling samples can be found in `/Machine-Teaching-Examples`.

### C#

[cartpole](https://github.com/microsoft/microsoft-bonsai-api/tree/main/CSharp/samples/Microsoft.Bonsai.Api.Samples.Cartpole) - Classic CartPole simulator in C#. Balancing an inverted pendulum on a moving cart.

### Java

[cartpole](https://github.com/microsoft/cartpole-java) - Classic CartPole simulator in Java. Balancing an inverted pendulum on a moving cart.

### Typescript

[adder](https://github.com/microsoft/microsoft-bonsai-api/tree/main/Typescript/samples/adder) - Simple simulator that adds numbers and computes a reward based on the result.

## Simulator Integration Checklist & Best Practices
- [ ] Make sure workspace is registered & correct.
- [ ] **Error handling**: Any cloud service can have transient errors and our SDK have Retry policy in place, but not all errors can be retried, so a good error handling logic will make your sim sessions more robust.
- [ ] **Enable logging**: If you are hitting issues. Enable logging in BonsaiClientConfig. And set the right LogLevel to get more information.
